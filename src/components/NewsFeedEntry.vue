Philippines is a culturally diverse country, so it is quite understandable for our ancestors to carry false teachings in terms of health and safety. &nbsp;</p><p>For example, albularyo is a person who consults with the occult and paranormal events in order to supposedly heal a patient, however since we are already well-versed in how to heal people, we know that consulting with the dead or deities are NOT the reason why people were being healed then.It was because of the wonders of herbal medicines, that allows these albularyos to heal people.</p><h2>What are Your Sources?</h2><p>Well, even though our studies are heavily scoped in the Philippines, there is no denying to the fact that other countries have a plethora of information regarding alternative remedies. Therefore, aside from real, scientific facts backed by the Department of Health (DOH) of the Philippines, we also used peer-reviewed, highly trusted sources from outside the country.</p><h2>Is This Risky?</h2><p>Tackling the human body sometimes can be risky, that\'s why our directory system uses hard-facts in showing the information when it comes to remedies. We are using DOH\'s years worth of experience to populate our data, therefore, as trustworthy DOH and DOST is, you can also trust this system.</p>',
